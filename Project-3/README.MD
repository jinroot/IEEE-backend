The project works flawlessly if you ignore the security issues.

To start off I don't recommend anyone to take any of the code in this 
project to a real life project, as its non realistic, full of security 
issues and not efficient what so ever. 

I was going to write a step by step README file to explain how to 
recreate the code and how it works, but after the nonsense that I had to 
code to get it to work I am not going to bother with that anymore.

If you want to recreate it for some reason import the schema and run 
either the "login-page.php", "signup-page.php" or "dashboard.php". The 
code should run itself from there.

As of last why I wouldn't be writing a step by step README is because it 
would be a waste of time, no one in his right mind should use this code 
in real project.

(see the attached meme for one of the reasons)
